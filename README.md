# ðŸ¥’ GurkeCrypt

GurkeCrypt is a simple and fast Rust-based tool for encoding and decoding secret messages using:
- Morse code
- Runic alphabet
- Mobile phone cipher (based on phone keypads)

# âœ¨ Motivation

This project was created as a lightweight and handy utility for preparing encrypted messages for children's summer camps. These camps often involve treasure hunts and adventure games that use ciphers to create engaging puzzles and clues.

As the author, Iâ€™ve spent most of my life involved in these camps â€” first as a child, later as a leader â€” and I wanted to build a tool that would make it easy to prepare and decode messages in a fun and flexible way.
